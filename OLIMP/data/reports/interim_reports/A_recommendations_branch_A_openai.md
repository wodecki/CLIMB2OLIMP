# Branch A Recommendations (OPENAI)\n\n# AI-Driven Digital Transformation Roadmap  
### Recommendation Report for Reaching Level E Maturity (OLIMP Model)

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

**Overall assessment**

The company is already experimenting with generative-AI (e.g., automated product-development processes at level D), yet foundational enablers are uneven. The gap analysis shows:

* ORGANIZATION & PROCESSES – average level **B/C**; islands of excellence (life-cycle management at **E**) coexist with clear bottlenecks (AI collaboration tools, playbooks, continuous-improvement loops at **A/B**).
* BUDGET – average **B/C**; strategic value-based prioritisation is strong (**E**), but systematic funding, capability building and external expertise are under-funded (**A–C**).
* ETHICS & REGULATIONS – average **C**; data-privacy and bias controls partially deployed, while employee awareness, cyber-security depth and explainability require major uplift (**A/B**).

**Key areas requiring attention**

1. Enterprise-wide integration of AI into every product-development flow.  
2. Institutionalised AI tool-stack and playbooks for daily work.  
3. Continuous-improvement (CI) engine for all AI solutions (MLOps + Lean).  
4. Secure, ethical and compliant AI usage reinforced by culture & governance.  
5. Multi-year investment plan covering infrastructure, skills and innovation.  

**Transformation priorities**

Phase 1: Close the most critical enabler gaps (tooling, ethics, funding).  
Phase 2: Scale AI integration & automation across >80 % of products.  
Phase 3: Optimise, standardise and innovate to sustain Level E maturity.

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES  

| Capability | Current | Target | Main Challenges |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| AI integration in NPD processes | B | E | Limited to selected products; lack of standard workflows. |
| Generative-AI automation | D | E | Automation exists but not 100 % coverage or orchestration. |
| AI-assisted decision making | D | E | Key decisions covered, but scattered data sources and little explainability. |
| AI collaboration tools | A | E | No common stack (e.g., GitLab, MLFlow, prompt hubs, vector DBs). |
| Continuous-improvement cycles | B | E | Sporadic Kaizen; no MLOps/Model-Ops feedback loops. |
| AI life-cycle process | E | E | Strength – can be leveraged as blueprint. |
| Generative-AI NPD playbook | A | E | No documented, organisation-wide guide. |

**Recommended development path**

1. **Standardise & scale integration (B➔C➔D)**
   * Map all product pipelines; insert AI touchpoints (ideation, simulation, cost estimation, compliance checks).
   * Introduce low-code AI connectors (Azure ML Pipelines / AWS Sagemaker Pipelines / Dataiku) to speed adoption.

2. **Full automation (D➔E)**
   * Deploy orchestrators (e.g., Airflow, Prefect) with APIs to CAD/PLM, ERP and CRM.
   * Implement AI-generated code & design review bots (GitHub Copilot, CodeWhisperer).

3. **Decision Intelligence (D➔E)**
   * Build unified semantic layer (e.g., DataBricks Lakehouse with Unity Catalog) feeding real-time dashboards and explainable AI models (using SHAP, LIME).

4. **Tool stack rollout (A➔B➔C➔D➔E)**
   * Phase 1: Provide shared experiment-tracking (MLflow) and prompt-management repos (PromptHub).  
   * Phase 2: Enterprise licences for collaboration suites (Miro + Figma + ChatGPT Enterprise with retrieval plug-ins).  
   * Phase 3: Integrate tools into daily workflows via Single-Sign-On & usage KPIs.

5. **Continuous-Improvement & MLOps (B➔C➔D➔E)**
   * Adopt GitOps + CI/CD for models (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitLab).  
   * Define golden-signals (drift, bias, cost) and automate retraining triggers.

6. **AI Playbook (A➔B➔C➔D➔E)**
   * Draft v1 within 3 months; include governance, prompt-engineering standards, success metrics, and reuse library.

**Concrete actions**

* Establish **AI Center of Excellence (CoE)** reporting to CTO; mandate: standards, tooling, playbook, CI.  
* Run boot-camp for product-development squads on “AI in NPD 101”.  
* Pilot **Digital‐Thread project** connecting PLM↔CAD↔ERP with vector search for design reuse.  
* Introduce **Design-for-AI reviews** at each stage-gate.
