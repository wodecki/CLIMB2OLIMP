_Recommendation Report for Reaching OLIMP Maturity Level E_  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

**Overall assessment**  
The organisation already has several islands of excellence (e.g., automated AI model deployment and HPC resources), but it remains at **Level B/C** in most foundational capabilities—especially cloud utilisation, knowledge management, budget governance and AI-driven product-development processes.  

**Key areas requiring attention**  
1. Technology: full cloud/hybrid architecture, real-time data fabric, unified MLOps tool-chain, enterprise-wide AI integration.  
2. People: AI project-management skills, enterprise knowledge-sharing culture, systematic up-/re-skilling.  
3. Organisation & Processes: end-to-end AI-supported new-product-development (NPD) workflow, continuous-improvement loops, formal AI playbooks.  
4. Budget & Governance: multi-year AI investment plan, external-consultancy allocation, value-based project prioritisation framework.  

**Transformation priorities**  
• Close the cloud, integration and scalability gaps to unlock existing computing power.  
• Institutionalise AI knowledge and project-management competences.  
• Embed AI and data-driven decision-making into every NPD stage.  
• Secure predictable funding streams tied to measurable business value.

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 Technology and Infrastructure  

| Capability | Current | Target | Main Challenges |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Cloud for AI data | B | E | Legacy on-prem storage, fragmented data silos |
| Scalable infrastructure | C | E | Limited elasticity outside core HPC cluster |
| Enterprise AI integration (ERP/CRM/…)| C | E | Point-to-point interfaces, no API gateway |
| Real-time data processing | C | E | Batch-oriented ETL, latency > seconds |
| MLOps lifecycle tooling | C | E | Multiple tools, no standard workflows |
| AI tool adoption (Copilot, ChatGPT) | D | E | Local optimisations, lack of security guard-rails |
| Solution scalability | B | E | Pilot models cannot auto-scale across BU’s |

**Recommended development path & actions**  
1. **Adopt a hybrid–multi-cloud data platform** (Azure/GCP/AWS) with lakehouse architecture; migrate 70 % of AI workloads in 18 months.  
2. **Deploy an event-streaming layer** (Kafka/Kinesis/PubSub) + low-latency feature store for real-time inference.  
3. **Standardise on one MLOps stack** (e.g., MLFlow + Kubeflow on Kubernetes) governed by DevSecOps policies.  
4. **Implement an API gateway + message bus** to decouple generative-AI services from ERP/CRM/PLM.  
5. **Roll out enterprise AI productivity suite** (Microsoft 365 Copilot with custom connectors) after data-governance hardening.  
6. **Introduce autoscaling patterns** (KEDA/HPA) and infrastructure-as-code (Terraform) to reach elastically scalable Level E.  

### 2.2 People and Competencies  

| Capability | Current | Target | Gap |
|------------|---------|--------|-----|
| AI awareness | D | E | Limited to most departments |
| Data & prompting skills | D | E | Training not company-wide |
| AI project-management training | **A** | E | Virtually non-existent |
| Knowledge management culture | **A** | E | Siloed “personal drives” |

**Recommended development path & actions**  
1. **Launch an AI Academy** – tiered curriculum (Foundational → Practitioner → Expert) covering Python, prompt engineering, ethics & governance.  
2. **Certify 100 % of PMs** in “AI-enabled Agile & PRINCE2.” Target: 50 % by month 12, 100 % by month 24.  
3. **Establish a Knowledge Hub** on Confluence/SharePoint with auto-tagging and retrieval powered by internal GPT model (“AskMeBot”).  
4. **Gamify knowledge sharing** (badges, leaderboards) to drive platform adoption above 80 % active users.  
5. **Create a community of practice** (CoP) with quarterly hackathons and brown-bag sessions.  

### 2.3 Organisation and Processes  

| Process Aspect | Current | Target | Gap |
|----------------|---------|--------|-----|
| AI integration in NPD | C | E | Partial, some products |
| Product-development automation | B | E | Only isolated steps |
| AI-assisted decision-making | C | E | Limited coverage |
| Tools for AI teams | C | E | Inconsistent |
| Continuous-improvement cycles | **A** | E | None today |
| AI development guidebook | **A** | E | Missing |

**Recommended development path & actions**  
1. **Map current NPD value-stream**, identify AI insertion points (ideation, concept selection, DFM, testing, launch).  
2. **Create an AI Process Playbook** (SOPs, RACI, templates) aligned with ISO 56002 & CRISP-DM.  
3. **Introduce AI-first stage-gate** including ethics, bias, cost-benefit checkpoints.  
4. **Automate repetitive NPD tasks** (spec drafting, bill-of-materials generation, variant simulation) using generative AI agents.  
5. **Implement a Kaizen-for-AI cadence** (Plan-Build-Measure-Learn every 4-6 weeks) with retrospectives feeding the Knowledge Hub.  
6. **Roll out collaboration tool-chain** (Jira, Miro, Teams) integrated with GPT plug-ins.
