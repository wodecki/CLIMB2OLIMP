---

## 1. Executive Summary
| Dimension | Average Maturity | Key Gaps |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Technology & Infrastructure | B-/C | Non-scalable on-prem IT, partial cloud, limited real-time data, weak MLOps |
| People & Competencies | C | Fragmented AI awareness, few interdisciplinary squads, ad-hoc external experts |
| Organization & Processes | B- | AI almost absent from NPD*, low automation, missing governance & toolchain |
| Budget Discipline | C | No stable funding for pilots/skills, sporadic spend on consultants |

\*NPD – New Product Development  

**Transformation priorities**  
1. Build a cloud-first, MLOps-enabled, real-time data platform (Levels B → E).  
2. Upskill and reorganise people into cross-functional AI product squads (Levels C → E).  
3. Embed AI into every step of New Product Development with clear life-cycle governance (Levels A → E).  
4. Introduce rolling 3-year AI investment planning and a “pilot–scale–operationalise” funding model.

## 2. Analysis by Areas

### 2.1 TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE
**Current state & challenges**  
• Core infra at Level A/B; limited elasticity, mostly on-prem.  
• Generative-AI integration is Level D, but hampered by manual workarounds and batch data flows (Level B for real-time).  
• Lifecycle tools (MLflow, Kubeflow, Databricks) only partially used (Level B).  
• Compute only moderate (Level C); GPU/TPU shortage delays experiments.

**Recommended development path (B → E)**  
1. **B → C**: Migrate 40 % of AI workloads to cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure), adopt containerisation (K8s) and IaC (Terraform).  
2. **C → D**: Implement enterprise data lakehouse; deploy CI/CD & CI/CT pipelines for models (GitOps, MLflow, Feature Store).  
3. **D → E**: Move to “Real-time Everything”: Kafka / Pulsar event streams, serverless inference, auto-scaling GPU clusters; full API mesh with ERP/CRM/SRM via REST/GraphQL.

**Concrete actions**  
• Select cloud landing-zone and finish network/security baseline in month 3.  
• Purchase 8 × A100 instances (or Azure NDv5) for R&D, add budget reservation.  
• Introduce Model Registry + automated rollback; enforce blue-green deployments.  
• Embed AI SaaS tools (OpenAI, Microsoft Copilot, Anthropic Claude) in M365/Slack company-wide.

### 2.2 PEOPLE AND COMPETENCIES
**Current state & challenges**  
• AI literacy pockets (Level C) but no organisation-wide programme.  
• Prompt engineering, data analysis training exists only for some teams (Level D).  
• External consultants engaged ad-hoc (Level B).  
• Knowledge hub already strong (Level E) – leverage it.

**Development path (C → E)**  
1. **C → D**: Launch compulsory “AI Fundamentals for Everyone” (6 h e-learning + 1-day workshop).  
2. **D → E**: Establish **AI Guilds** (domain experts, data scientists, engineers, PMs).  
3. Create a pool of “AI Champions” (10 % of workforce) to coach others.

**Concrete actions**  
• Sign enterprise agreements with Coursera/Udacity for GenAI nanodegrees.  
• Embed prompt-engineering labs using ChatGPT Enterprise sandbox.  
• Set KPI: 85 % of employees certified *AI-Aware* by month 12.  
• Framework contract with top-tier AI consultancy for 120 person-days/year.

### 2.3 ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES
**Current state & challenges**  
• AI in NPD at Level A–B: almost no integration or automation.  
• Decision making partially data-driven (Level B).  
• Tools for AI teams missing (Level A).  
• Life-cycle governance for AI software defined only in few projects (Level C).

**Development path (A → E)**  
1. **A → B/C**: Map end-to-end NPD process; identify 3 quick-win AI use-cases (e.g., concept-generation, cost estimation, virtual prototyping).  
2. **C → D**: Roll out **AI Product Playbook** – templates, checklists, ethics guardrails.  
3. **D → E**: Full AI-augmented Stage-Gate with continuous improvement loops and automated documentation.

**Concrete actions**  
• Appoint **Head of AI Product Operations** (month 2).  
• Integrate Jira/ADO with MLflow & Slack to create single source of truth.  
• Introduce OKR cadence that ties business value to model metrics.  
• Adopt ISO 42001 (AI Management System) for governance by year 3.
