  4. Institutionalized processes (CI/CD/CT for AI, knowledge reuse, KPIs)  
  5. Strategic, multi-year AI investment plan

- **Transformation priorities**
  - “No-regret” tech upgrades (GPU/Tensor instances, hybrid cloud, MLOps)  
  - People: from scattered training to an organization-wide “AI Academy”  
  - Processes: embed AI in every product-development decision loop and implement continuous-improvement cycles  
  - Governance & funding: move from project-by-project to portfolio-level steering
