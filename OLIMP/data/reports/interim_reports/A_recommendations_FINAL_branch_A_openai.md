## 1. Executive Summary  

**Overall assessment**  
The company already owns a first-class technical backbone for AI (scalable compute, MLOps tooling, widespread AI tools adoption and awareness). The key blockers for reaching Level E across OLIMP are:  

1. Fragmented integration of generative AI with core business systems (ERP/CRM/SCM/PLM).  
2. Low automation of model deployment and real-time data processing.  
3. Immature organizational processes and methods around AI-enabled product development (most questions at A–C).  
4. Insufficient long-term budgeting, limited funding of pilots and external expertise.  
5. Gaps in advanced competency building and cross-functional collaboration.  

**Transformation priorities (next 36 months)**  
1. Build an enterprise-wide Integration & Data Fabric to connect generative-AI services with all operational systems.  
2. Industrialise MLOps (CI/CD/CT) and real-time data streaming.  
3. Redesign product-development governance: AI playbook, stage-gate templates, KPI framework, continuous-improvement loops.  
4. Scale people capabilities: “AI Academy”, role clarity, interdisciplinary squads, strong knowledge-sharing culture.  
5. Secure sustainable financing and value-based portfolio management for AI initiatives.

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 Technology & Infrastructure  

| Key item | Current | Target | Main challenges |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| Scalable IT infra / MLOps | E | E | none – leverage as accelerator |
| AI ↔ ERP/CRM/PLM integration | A | E | Missing middleware & APIs, data silos |
| Automated model deployment | A | E | Manual hand-offs, no CI/CD for ML |
| Cloud adoption for AI workloads | B | E | Only storage in cloud, processing still on-prem |
| Real-time data processing | A | E | Batch pipelines, no streaming |
| Data-ready infrastructure (big data) | D | E | Optimisation for petabyte-scale & GPU clusters |
| Solution scalability | C | E | Non-standardised architectures |

**Recommended development path & concrete actions**  
1. 0–6 m:  
   • Select iPaaS (e.g., MuleSoft, Boomi) and design canonical data model.  
   • Stand-up central Feature Store & Model Registry (MLflow 2.x).  
   • Pilot CI/CD/CT pipeline with GitOps (Argo CD) on one model.  

2. 6–18 m:  
   • Migrate 60–70 % AI workloads to cloud GPU/TPU nodes (AWS SageMaker, Azure ML).  
   • Deploy Kafka + Spark-Structured-Streaming for real-time feeds.  
   • Containerise all GenAI micro-services (Kubernetes + KServe).  

3. 18–36 m:  
   • Full bidirectional integration with ERP/CRM/PLM via event-driven APIs.  
   • Auto-scaling inference fleet, cost-optimised spot instances.  
   • Real-time observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana + Evidently AI).  

### 2.2 People & Competencies  

| Item | Current | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| AI awareness | E | E |
| Programming / prompting skills | B | E |
| Interdisciplinary AI teams | D | E |
| Knowledge management platform | E | E |

**Development path & actions**  
• Launch “AI Academy” with three tracks: Foundations, Advanced (MLOps, Prompt Engineering, LLM fine-tuning), Leadership.  
• Certify 80 % of product managers and engineers on GenAI within 18 months (Coursera GenAI Specialisation, Microsoft Fabric).  
• Formal mentorship program: internal experts + external advisors.  
• Define RACI matrices; embed data scientists, product owners, designers, regulatory experts into every squad.  
• Quarterly hackathons; reward knowledge-base contributions.  

### 2.3 Organization & Processes  

Majority of questions at Level A–C → biggest gap.  

Key gaps  
1. AI not embedded in Stage-Gate / Agile PDP.  
2. No enterprise AI playbook or governance charter.  
3. Limited automation & decision support.  
4. Weak KPI usage, front-loading, knowledge re-use.  

Actions  
1. Draft “GenAI Product Development Guide” (templates, checklists, risk matrix, ethics).  
2. Insert AI deliverables in each PDP phase (idea scoping → concept gen via LLMs, design space exploration, synthetic data testing, post-launch analytics).  
3. Deploy collaboration toolchain (Atlassian Jira + Confluence + Copilot, Miro) integrated with code + data repos.  
4. Continuous-improvement loop: A/B test AI features, collect feedback into backlog, auto-retrain models.  
5. Establish AI Governance Board (legal, security, business) – monthly reviews.  

### 2.4 Budget & Portfolio Management  

Current levels A–C.  

Actions  
• Move to rolling 3-year AI investment plan aligned with corporate strategy.  
• Create “AI Innovation Fund” (1–2 % of annual revenue) for pilots.  
• Introduce stage-gated funding tied to value KPIs (NPV, cycle-time reduction).  
• Pre-approve budget line for external consultants & cloud spending spikes.
