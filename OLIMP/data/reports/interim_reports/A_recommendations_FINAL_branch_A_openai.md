## 1. Executive Summary  

**Overall assessment**  
The company already owns a highly scalable, cloud–native infrastructure (Level E) and runs company-wide knowledge-management platforms, but the human and organisational capabilities as well as the practical integration of AI into daily work and core systems are at an early stage (mostly Levels A–C). The biggest gaps are:

* Lack of integration of generative AI with ERP/CRM and other line-of-business systems (Tech Level A).  
* Limited automation of model deployment and immature MLOps tool-chain (Tech Level B/C).  
* Minimal compute capacity dedicated to AI workloads and no real-time data pipelines (Tech Level A).  
* Very low AI awareness, skills, and interdisciplinary collaboration (People Level A).  
* Fragmented processes and missing AI playbook for new-product development (Org Level A–D).  
* Budget planning for AI is mostly short term (Budget Level B–D).

**Key areas requiring attention**  
1. People & Competencies – create a workforce that understands and embraces AI.  
2. System Integration & MLOps – connect generative AI to existing digital core and automate life-cycle.  
3. Product-development Processes – embed AI decision support and establish an end-to-end AI playbook.  

**Transformation priorities (next 36 months)**  
1. Build an AI Centre of Excellence (CoE) and interdisciplinary squads.  
2. Launch pilot integrations (ERP → GenAI assisted BOM creation, CRM → GenAI customer-insight bot).  
3. Deploy a managed MLOps platform (e.g., Azure ML, AWS Sagemaker, Google Vertex AI) with CI/CD.  
4. Upskill 100 % of employees in AI literacy and 30 % in advanced prompt-engineering/programming.  
5. Formalise AI product-development guidebook, governance, and continuous-improvement loops.

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 Technology and Infrastructure  

| Capability | Current | Target | Main Challenges |
|------------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| GenAI ↔ ERP/CRM integration | A | E | API strategy missing, data-model alignment, security |
| Automated model deployment | B | E | No CI/CD pipelines, manual hand-offs |
| MLOps life-cycle tools | C | E | Partial tool usage, no standards |
| Real-time data processing | A | E | Batch-oriented architecture |
| Compute power for AI | A | E | Limited GPU/TPU capacity, no auto-scaling |
| Day-to-day AI tools | A | E | Low adoption, no enablement plan |

**Recommended development path & concrete actions**  
1. **Integration blueprint (0-3 m)** – map business processes, define canonical data models, select integration middleware (e.g., MuleSoft, Azure Logic Apps).  
2. **Adopt managed MLOps platform (3-9 m)** – enable model registry, automated testing, canary releases.  
3. **Implement event-driven architecture (6-18 m)** – Kafka/Kinesis, Apache Flink or Spark Structured Streaming for real-time feeds.  
4. **Provision elastic GPU clusters (0-6 m)** – reserved instances + spot capacity; evaluate on-prem GPU pods for sensitive data.  
5. **Roll-out AI productivity suite (0-6 m)** – Microsoft 365 Copilot, Google Duet, internal ChatGPT with corporate-data plug-ins.  
6. **Security & compliance** – integrate with IAM/Zero-Trust, set up AI model governance (bias, explainability, audit logs).  

### 2.2 People and Competencies

   • Executives: AI strategy & ethics  
   • Developers/Data scientists: LangChain, Vector DBs, RAG patterns  
   • Product owners: prompt design, user-story mapping with LLM.  
   Certified via Coursera/Udacity + internal hackathons.  
3. **Establish AI CoE & guilds (0-3 m)** – 8-12 senior profiles (data, ML, domain, DevOps, legal).  
4. **Interdisciplinary squads (6-12 m)** – embed data scientist + prompt engineer in every NPD team.  
5. **Mentoring & Communities (6-18 m)** – Slack channels, internal StackOverflow, monthly brown-bags.  
6. **Incentives & career paths (6-18 m)** – link performance bonus to AI up-skilling KPIs.  

### 2.3 Organization and Processes  

| Capability | Current | Target |
|------------|---------|--------|
| AI in NPD processes | D | E |
| AI-driven automation of NPD | D | E |
| AI decision support | C | E |
| AI SDLC governance | D | E |
| AI playbook / guidebook | A | E |

**Actions**  
1. **Design the “AI-enabled NPD Playbook” (0-6 m)** – stages, templates, RACI, gates, ethics checklist.  
2. **Embed GenAI in Stage-Gate** – automatic idea scoring, concept generation, cost/ROI projection (6-12 m).  
3. **Decision-support dashboards (6-18 m)** – LLM-powered chat on product KPIs, scenario simulation.  
4. **Process automatisation** – e.g., auto-generation of test cases or CAD models with LLM-powered scripts (12-24 m).  
5. **Lifecycle governance (6-12 m)** – adopt ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system), define Model Cards & Data Sheets.  
6. **Continuous-improvement loops** – post-mortems with causal-AI analysis, feed lessons-learned into knowledge base.
