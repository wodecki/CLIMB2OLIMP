## 1. Executive Summary  

The gap analysis shows that the organisation is **mid-maturity (B/C)** in most Technology & Infrastructure and Data capabilities, while **Ethics & Regulations** is uneven (D for some controls, A/B for bias & documentation, C for privacy).  
Key findings:  

* Limited scalability and compute for large-scale AI (infrastructure levels A–C).  
* Fragmented integrations with ERP/CRM and manual model deployment (levels A/B).  
* Data quality, automation and governance only partially embedded (mostly B/C).  
* Ethical AI foundations exist, but bias mitigation, documentation and cybersecurity are still nascent (A/B/C).  

Transformation priorities (0-36 months):  

1. **Industrial-grade, cloud-native AI platform** (scalable compute, automated CI/CD for models, enterprise integrations).  
2. **Data excellence programme** (quality, lineage, automated pipelines, single data catalogue).  
3. **Responsible-AI framework** (bias monitoring, privacy-by-design, continuous compliance).  

Achieving Level E in all OLIMP categories will unlock faster product innovation, lower development cost (≈ 15–25 %), and a differentiated market position as a trusted, AI-enabled organisation.

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 Technology & Infrastructure  

| Capability | Present | Challenges |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Scalable IT for AI | B | On-prem servers bottleneck GPU/TPU capacity; no elastic scaling. |
| GenAI integration (ERP/CRM) | B | Ad-hoc APIs; no event-driven architecture. |
| Model deployment automation | A | Manual release, environment drift, slow rollback. |
| Cloud adoption for AI | E | Strength: full cloud use – leverage as foundation. |
| MLOps lifecycle tools | E | Strength – maintain. |
| Big-data readiness | B | Storage/I/O limits, no tiered data lake. |
| Real-time processing | B | Batch-oriented ETL, sub-second latency not met. |
| Compute power | A | No dedicated GPU farm, limited spot instances. |
| Everyday AI tools | B | Local pilots (ChatGPT, Copilot) but no SSO & policy control. |
| Solution scalability | C | Pilots scale only to departments. |

Recommended path to Level E:  

1. **C** – Lift-and-shift core workloads to managed Kubernetes; adopt Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).  
2. **D** – Implement feature store, event-stream (Kafka/Pulsar), GPU autoscaling; integrate GenAI via service mesh.  
3. **E** – Federated multi-cloud, serverless inference, policy-driven FinOps; full AI tool suite with SSO & governance.

Concrete actions (next 12 months)  
• Sign enterprise agreement with hyperscaler for reserved GPU capacity.  
• Deploy Kubeflow / MLflow pipelines with GitOps.  
• Implement API gateway and message bus connecting ERP (e.g., SAP BTP), CRM (e.g., Salesforce), PLM.  
• Roll-out Microsoft Copilot with DLP & logging.  
• Introduce vector database (Pinecone/Weaviate) to enable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

### 2.2 Data  

| Capability | Present | Challenges |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Data quality | B | Inconsistent formats, manual cleansing. |
| Analytics automation | B | Scattered scripts, few Airflow jobs. |
| Data centralisation | C | Multiple silos; partial data lake. |
| Data quality tools | E | Tool exists but not feeding governance loop. |
| Data strategy | D | Documented, not fully enforced. |
| Data collection/cleaning automation | B | Few connectors, heavy Excel use. |
| Internal & external data integration | E | Good – maintain. |
| Standard data model & metadata | C | SME-owned, no enterprise schema. |
| GenAI for data visualisation | C | Pilots only. |

Recommended path:  

1. **C** – Enterprise data lakehouse (Delta/Apache Iceberg) with streaming ingestion.  
2. **D** – Active metadata / DataOps (OpenLineage, Great Expectations as code).  
3. **E** – Self-service semantics layer, AutoML analytics, GenAI dashboards (Power BI Copilot).

Concrete actions:  
• Establish Data Governance Council; appoint Chief Data Officer (if absent).  
• Build single business glossary in Collibra / Azure Purview.  
• Replace manual ETL with declarative pipelines (dbt / Lakehouse Federation).  
• Integrate visualisation LLM agents (e.g., Tableau Pulse, MicroStrategy AI) for narrative insights.  
• Expand data strategy to cover synthetic data generation for rare events.

### 2.3 Ethics & Regulations  

| Capability | Present | Challenges |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Ethical design principles | D | Framework exists, not universal. |
| Data privacy & security | C | Policies ≈ 60 % coverage; shadow IT. |
| Explainability / trust | C | Limited model cards, no XAI dashboards. |
| Backup & protection | E | Mature – keep. |
| Bias & fairness mitigation | A | No formal reviews. |
| Regulatory compliance audits | D | Annual audits only. |
| AI decision audit trails | C | Logs stored, no governance workflow. |
| Employee data-protection awareness | D | Training annual only. |
| Cybersecurity tech | B | Basic EDR, no AI-specific posture. |
| AI use documentation | A | Virtually none. |

Path to Level E:  

1. **C** – Appoint Responsible-AI Officer; adopt Model Cards + Data Sheets templates.  
2. **D** – Implement bias/fairness library (Aequitas, Fairlearn) in CI pipeline; ISO-42001 alignment.  
3. **E** – Real-time monitoring for drift & bias; continuous GDPR/AI-Act compliance; full audit & versioned documentation.

Concrete actions:  
• Run “ethical threat modelling” workshops for existing AI products.  
• Deploy privacy-enhancing tech (differential privacy, confidential compute).  
• Integrate AI-specific SIEM rules; zero-trust segmentation for inference endpoints.  
• Launch quarterly e-learning on data ethics, mandatory for all staff.
