## Transition from Current State to Level E Maturity

---

## 1. Executive Summary
| | Findings |
|---|---|
|Overall Assessment | The company is **AI-progressive but fragmented**. Technology shows isolated Level E capabilities (e.g., compute, ERP/CRM integration) while foundational elements such as scalable cloud, MLOps tooling and real-time data streaming remain at Level A-C. People & Competencies lag behind (largely B) and Organization & Processes are uneven (B-D). |
|Key Gaps | 1) **Foundational infrastructure & MLOps** (cloud, lifecycle tools, real-time pipelines). 2) **Workforce enablement** (AI training, interdisciplinary teams, project-management upskilling). 3) **Process automation & decision-support** in New Product Development (NPD); many workflows still manual or undocumented. |
|Transformation Priorities | 1) Build a secure, elastic cloud & data platform with automated CI/CD/CT for ML/LLM models. 2) Launch enterprise-wide AI capability program (skills, roles, knowledge-sharing). 3) Institutionalise AI-first NPD processes (end-to-end automation, KPI-driven continuous improvement). |

## 2. Analysis by Areas

### 2.1 TECHNOLOGY & INFRASTRUCTURE
Current State  
• Scalable IT infrastructure: **Level A**  
• Cloud adoption: **Level C** (partial)  
• MLOps lifecycle tools: **Level A**  
• Real-time data processing: **Level A**  
• Model deployment: **Level D** (largely automated)  
• Integration with core systems & compute power: **Level E**  

Main Challenges  
1. Fragmented on-prem / cloud environment → inhibits scale and speed.  
2. Manual or siloed model lifecycle; limited observability & governance.  
3. No real-time data fabric → Generative AI solutions can’t deliver instant insight.  
4. AI tools not embedded in daily work.

Recommended Development Path & Actions  
1. **Level A→B→C**:  
   • Select primary hyperscaler; set up Landing Zone with IaC (Terraform) & security baselines.  
   • Migrate 30 % of AI-related workloads; adopt managed data lake (e.g., AWS Lake Formation).  
2. **Level C→D**:  
   • Implement Kubernetes-based ML platform (Kubeflow or AWS SageMaker/K8s combo).  
   • Deploy feature store, model registry, automated CI/CD pipelines; embed Model Cards.  
3. **Level D→E**:  
   • Introduce streaming (Kafka/Kinesis) & Lambda/Kappa architecture for <1 sec latency.  
   • Adopt LLMOps stack (LangChain, VectorDBs, prompt management).  
   • Enterprise rollout of Gen-AI copilots (Microsoft 365 Copilot, domain-specific chatbots).  
   • Continuous cost-optimisation (Spot, serverless, AI accelerators).

### 2.2 PEOPLE & COMPETENCIES
Current State  
• AI awareness: **D**  
• Technical / prompting skills: **B**  
• Interdisciplinary AI teams: **B**  
• Project-management for AI: **A**  
• Knowledge management platform usage: **D**

Main Challenges  
1. Training limited to pockets; no enterprise curriculum.  
2. Lack of AI product managers & prompt engineers.  
3. Sporadic use of external experts; no community of practice.

Recommended Development Path & Actions  
1. **Level B→C** (0-6 m):  
   • Launch “AI Essentials” upskilling (Coursera/Databricks Academy) for 100 % of staff.  
   • Certify 20 “AI Champions” per business unit.  
2. **Level C→D** (6-18 m):  
   • Establish **AI Guild** (cross-functional CoE) and rotate SMEs into projects.  
   • Introduce role taxonomy: AI Product Owner, MLOps Engineer, Prompt Engineer.  
   • Implement knowledge-sharing portal with retrieval-augmented search (SharePoint + Azure OpenAI).  
3. **Level D→E** (18-36 m):  
   • Mandatory AI-PM curriculum (PMI-CP, CRISP-DM extensions).  
   • 100 % employees complete annual AI ethics & prompt-engineering refresh.  
   • SLA-based engagement model for external consultants; mentoring cascade to internal staff.

### 2.3 ORGANIZATION & PROCESSES (incl. NPD)
Current State  
• AI integrated in NPD: **D**  
• Process automation: **B**  
• AI-supported decision making: **B**  
• Continuous improvement cycles: **D**  
• AI lifecycle governance: **E** (already defined)  
• NPD guidebook: **D**

Main Challenges  
1. Manual, document-driven stages (ideation, feasibility, cost engineering).  
2. KPIs & knowledge reuse weak (CLIMB_2 scores A-B).  
3. Collaboration across functions and with customers is minimal.

Recommended Development Path & Actions  
1. **Level B→C**:  
   • Map all NPD sub-processes; identify quick-win automation (requirements clustering, concept generation with Gen-AI).  
   • Introduce digital Stage-Gate with integrated KPI dashboard (PowerBI).  
2. **Level C→D**:  
   • Deploy AI decision-support (scenario simulation, Monte Carlo, demand forecasting).  
   • Implement feedback loops: automated user telemetry, real-time cost tracking.  
3. **Level D→E**:  
   • Full “AI-First” NPD playbook: front-loading, generative design, virtual testing (CAE, CFD enhanced by AI).  
   • Continuous deployment of design iterations; digital twin integration.  
   • Incorporate sustainability metrics & circular-economy optimisation via AI.
