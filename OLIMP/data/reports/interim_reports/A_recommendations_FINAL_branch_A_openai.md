### Recommendation Report for Reaching Maturity Level E in All OLIMP Areas  
*(Prepared June 2024)*  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  
**Overall assessment**  
- Organization is already world-class in “Organization & Processes” (Level E) and owns a scalable AI-ready infrastructure.  
- Key gaps remain in:  
  1. Seamless technology integration & MLOps automation (mostly Level B/C).  
  2. People & Competencies (Level D → E).  
  3. Long-term Budgeting & Portfolio Governance (Level A).  

**Key areas requiring attention**  
1. Enterprise-wide integration of generative-AI services with core systems (ERP/CRM/PLM/SCM).  
2. Fully automated, compliant, and monitored AI lifecycle (MLOps Level E).  
3. Continuous up-/re-skilling of all employees and industrialization of knowledge management.  
4. Establishment of multi-year AI investment fund and value-based portfolio steering.  

**Transformation priorities (next 36 months)**  
- **Priority 1:** Set up AI Value Office & funding model (Budget from A→E).  
- **Priority 2:** Build production-grade MLOps platform, integrate LLMs, enable real-time data (Tech B/C→E).  
- **Priority 3:** Institutionalize company-wide AI academy, role certification, and expert communities (People D→E).  
- **Priority 4:** Sustain process excellence through continuous improvement loops and governance audits (keep Org at E).

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 Technology and Infrastructure  

| Sub-topic | Present | Main Challenges | Development Path | Concrete Actions |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| LLM integration with ERP/CRM/PLM | B | Point-to-point connections, limited APIs | C→D→E | – Deploy an API gateway (e.g., Azure API Mgt).<br>– Introduce an event-driven integration layer (Kafka).<br>– Implement AI service mesh (Istio) for observability.<br>– Gradually onboard all core systems. |
| MLOps & Model Lifecycle | B | Manual hand-offs, no standard toolkit | C→D→E | – Select enterprise MLOps stack (MLflow/Kubeflow or Vertex AI).<br>– Automate CI/CD, model registry, automated testing.<br>– Enforce governance policies (bias, privacy). |
| Automated model deployment | B | Scripts & manual approvals | C→D→E | – Adopt infrastructure-as-code (Terraform).<br>– Use GitOps (Argo CD).<br>– Deploy canary & A/B pipelines. |
| Real-time data processing | B | Batch-oriented architecture | C→D→E | – Implement streaming platform (Kafka/Flink).<br>– Optimize latency hotspots.<br>– Introduce feature store with online/offline parity. |

### 2.2 People and Competencies  

Current Level D: strong foundation but not pervasive.  
Development path: D → E.  

Action set:  
1. **AI Academy 360°** (mandatory baseline for all employees; advanced tracks for engineers & leaders).  
2. **Prompt Engineering Certification** using open-source tools (LangChain, Guidance).  
3. **Role Framework & Career Paths** – Data Product Owner, AI Ethicist, MLOps Engineer, etc.  
4. **Knowledge Graph & Internal StackOverflow** fed by lessons-learned.  
5. **External Expert Network** – multi-year contracts with leading AI labs/universities; “Professor-in-Residence” model.  
6. **Hackathons & Internal Kaggle-like challenges** every quarter to reinforce practice.  

### 2.3 Organization and Processes  

Already Level E – keep superiority via:  
- Annual process audits against ISO 42001 (AI Management System).  
- Continuous improvement: OKR cycle + post-mortems.  
- Expand AI governance board to include sustainability & ethics.  

### 2.4 Budget & Portfolio Governance  

Current Level A. Largest single blocker.  

Development path: A → E.  
Concrete actions:  
1. Create **AI Value Office (AIVO)** within next 3 months.  
2. Define **3-year rolling AI investment plan** aligned with corporate strategy.  
3. Introduce **stage-gate funding** tied to value KPIs (NPV, payback < 24 months).  
4. Allocate **2–3 % of annual revenue** as AI innovation fund.  
5. Embed **“AI first” prioritization rubric** in portfolio management.

## 3. Implementation Plan  

### Phase 1 – Pilot & Foundations (0-6 months)  
- Stand-up AIVO and secure executive sponsorship.  
- Select 2–3 high-value pilots (e.g., AI-assisted concept generation, automated spec creation).  
- Deploy MLOps MVP on cloud; automate data pipelines for pilots.  
- Launch AI Academy foundations; train 100 % of managers & pilot teams.  
- Draft AI policy (governance, ethics, security).  

### Phase 2 – Development & Scaling (6-18 months)  
- Industrialize MLOps: CI/CD, automated compliance, monitoring.  
- Integrate LLM services with ERP, CRM, PLM; roll out Copilot to 60 % of staff.  
- Implement real-time streaming & feature store.  
- Establish community of practice & monthly knowledge-sharing demos.  
- Expand budget model; 40 % of product portfolio evaluated with “AI first” rubric.  

### Phase 3 – Optimization & Excellence (18-36 months)  
- Full Level E integration across all systems.  
- 90-100 % automated model deployments with zero-touch ops.  
- Enterprise AI dashboard with live KPIs (see Sec. 5).  
- AI Academy advanced tracks for all (prompting, causal inference, RLHF).  
- Annual AI ethics & bias audit; ISO 42001 certification.  
- Continuous re-investment loop managed by AIVO.

## 4. Resources and Budget (rough order-of-magnitude)  

| Phase | CapEx/Opex (USD) | Key Human Resources | Tech & Tools |
|-------|------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| 1 | $1.5 M | • AIVO lead (1)<br>• MLOps squad (5)<br>• Data engineers (3)<br>• AI trainer (1) | Cloud subscription, GPUs (reserved), MLflow/Kubeflow, Azure OpenAI, Snowflake, Kafka. |
| 2 | $4 M | • Additional MLOps (5)<br>• Integration architects (3)<br>• Prompt engineers (5)<br>• Change-management lead (1) | API gateway, Service mesh, Feature store (Feast), Vector DB, Copilot licenses. |
