_Recommendation Report – Transition to Maturity Level E_  

---

## 1. Executive Summary  

**Overall assessment**  
The organization sits at an average maturity level of C- on Technology & Infrastructure, B- on People & Competencies, and B-/C on Organization & Processes. Budget planning is relatively advanced (level D), but funds are not yet directed toward skills, pilots, or innovation (levels A–B). CLIMB 2 results confirm weak cross-functional collaboration, limited formal processes, and low knowledge reuse.

**Key areas requiring attention**  
1. **Scalable, automated AI infrastructure** – current bottlenecks at levels A–C for scalability, data volumes, MLOps, and real-time processing.  
2. **Human capital & change management** – skills, awareness, interdisciplinary teaming, and project-management capabilities lag behind (mostly A/B).  
3. **Process integration & continuous improvement** – AI is not yet embedded in new-product-development (NPD) workflows; automation and decision support remain ad-hoc (levels A/B).  

**Transformation priorities**  
1. Build cloud-native, MLOps-enabled infrastructure that supports large-scale, real-time generative-AI workloads.  
2. Launch an enterprise-wide AI capability-building program (awareness → skilling → expert paths).  
3. Redesign NPD processes to be AI-first, data-driven, and continuously improved, supported by clear governance and metrics.

## 2. Analysis by Areas  

### 2.1 Technology and Infrastructure  

| Topic | Present | Main Challenges |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| Scalability of AI solutions | Level A | Legacy architectures, no elastic scaling |
| Cloud adoption | Level C | Hybrid silos, partial migrations |
| Model deployment automation | Level B | Manual steps, risk of drift |
| Data infrastructure (volume + real-time) | Levels B/C | Limited storage/compute; latency |
| MLOps / lifecycle tools | Level B | Tooling exists but not standardized |
| Compute power | Level E | Strength to leverage |
| Enterprise AI tools (Copilot, ChatGPT) | Level C | Not ubiquitous |

**Recommended development path**  
C  →  D (6–12 mo)  →  E (12–24 mo)  

**Concrete actions**  
1. Adopt a **single-tenant landing zone** in AWS/Azure/GCP with Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform).  
2. Introduce **managed feature store** (e.g., Feast) + **data lakehouse** (Delta Lake/Snowflake).  
3. Deploy **CI/CD/CT for ML** (GitLab CI, Argo, MLflow, Kubeflow pipelines).  
4. Implement **real-time streaming** (Kafka / Kinesis) for sensor & user data.  
5. Roll out **API gateway & service mesh** (Istio) for micro-services and model APIs.  
6. Create an **AI sandbox** for pilots; connect to ERP/CRM via event-driven architecture.  
7. Introduce **usage analytics & cost observability** to optimize GPU/TPU spending.  

### 2.2 People and Competencies  

| Topic | Present | Main Challenges |
|-------|---------|-----------------|

| Programming / prompt engineering | Level B | Isolated training, no standard curriculum |
| Interdisciplinary AI teams | Level B | Formed only for some projects |
| Project-management for AI | Level A | No formal training |
| Knowledge management | Level E | Strong platform – under-utilised |

**Recommended development path**  
B  →  C (3–6 mo)  →  D (6–18 mo)  →  E (18–30 mo)  

**Concrete actions**  
1. **Executive bootcamps** on Gen-AI strategy & ethics.  
2. Launch **“AI Fluency” e-learning path** (DataCamp, Coursera) – mandatory for ~80 % staff.  
3. Establish an **AI Centre of Excellence (CoE)** with rotating members (product, design, data, ops).  
4. Institute **prompt-engineering guilds**; run monthly hackathons on actual NPD tasks.  
5. Partner with universities / vendors for **certified MLOps & LLM fine-tuning courses**.  
6. Embed **AI project-management track** into the existing PMO (Scaled Agile, CRISP-DM).  
7. Leverage existing KM platform to publish **AI playbooks, reusable prompts, code snippets**.  

### 2.3 Organization and Processes  

| Topic | Present | Main Challenges |
|-------|---------|-----------------|

| Software/Model lifecycle | Level C | Fragmented governance |

**Recommended development path**  
B (quick wins)  →  C/D (12 mo)  →  E (24–36 mo)  

**Concrete actions**  
1. Map existing Stage-Gate to a **data-driven “AI-Gate” model** – each gate has metrics & model-health checks.  
2. Automate **requirement capture → ideation → concept generation** with LLM-powered assistants (ChatGPT Enterprise / Microsoft Copilot Studio).  
3. Deploy **digital thread** across PLM, ERP, CRM for single source of truth.  
4. Integrate **simulation & generative design** (Autodesk Fusion 360, nTopology) in early design.  
5. Introduce **continuous experimentation** (A/B tests, canary releases) for software-defined products.  
6. Create **feedback loops** using telemetry, user-voice, and synthetic‐data augmentation.  
7. Formalise **ML governance** (Model cards, Data sheets, Responsible AI policy).
