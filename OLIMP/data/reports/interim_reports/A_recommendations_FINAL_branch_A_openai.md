---

## 1. Executive Summary
### Overall Assessment
The company is already an advanced AI adopter in certain technology domains (full cloud use, automated model deployment and ERP/CRM integration) but lags behind in:
* Scalable, production-grade infrastructure and compute (Level A–B)
* Model-lifecycle management and MLOps (Level A)
* Company-wide AI tool usage and real-time data processing (Level B–C)
* Workforce skills, KM culture and cross-functional collaboration (Level B–D)
* Budget planning for AI (mostly Level A)

### Key Areas Requiring Attention
1. Modernise infrastructure & MLOps pipeline
2. Upskill employees and institutionalise knowledge-sharing
3. Embed AI decision support & continuous improvement in all product-development processes
4. Establish long-term AI funding model linked to value creation

### Transformation Priorities (0–36 months)
1. Foundation: close the **Technology/MLOps** gap (Levels A-C → D)  
2. People first: scale **competencies & KM** (Levels B-C → D)  
3. Process excellence: **AI-augmented decision-making** and automation (Level A → D)  
4. Institutionalisation: budget governance & full-scale optimisation (Level D → E)

## 2. Analysis by Areas

### 2.1 TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE
| Topic | Current | Target E | Main Challenges |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------------|
| Scalable infra | B | E | On-prem capacity limits, partial automation |
| MLOps / Model lifecycle tools | A | E | No standard platform, manual model governance |
| Data volume handling | B | E | Storage & throughput constraints |
| Real-time processing | C | E | Latency, streaming architecture missing |
| Compute power | A | E | GPU/TPU shortage, capacity management |
| Everyday AI tools | B | E | Fragmented adoption, no enterprise rollout |
| Solution scalability | D | E | Last-mile integration & orchestration |

**Development Path & Actions**
1. Move to hybrid multi-cloud with autoscaling Kubernetes clusters and GPU pools (Azure AKS + NVIDIA A100 or AWS EKS + Inferentia).  
2. Implement enterprise MLOps platform (e.g., **MLflow + Databricks**, **Azure Machine Learning** or **Kubeflow**) with CI/CD, model registry and drift monitoring.  
3. Deploy distributed data lakehouse (Delta Lake / Snowflake) optimised for petabyte scale; add Kafka or AWS Kinesis for streaming.  
4. Introduce feature store (Feast/Tecton) and online serving layer (<20 ms).  
5. Company-wide licence rollout of secure GenAI assistants (Microsoft 365 Copilot, ChatGPT Enterprise) with SSO & data-loss-prevention.  
6. Harden security & compliance – zero-trust, Infrastructure-as-Code, reproducible environments with Terraform.

### 2.2 PEOPLE AND COMPETENCIES
| Topic | Current | Target E | Gaps |
|-------|---------|----------|------|
| AI awareness | C | E | Limited to pockets of org |
| Technical training (coding/prompting) | B | E | No enterprise curriculum |
| Interdisciplinary teams | D | E | Not in all projects |
| External consultants | D | E | Ad-hoc; need strategic CoEs |
| KM platform | B | E | Dispersed tools, low adoption |

**Development Path & Actions**
1. Establish **AI Academy** (internal + external MOOCs) – mandatory baseline (Prompt Engineering, Python, Responsible AI) plus role-specific tracks.  
2. Create rotational **AI squads** per product line (PM, data scientist, engineer, designer, manufacturing, compliance).  
3. Launch **Mentor-Mentée** & peer programming sessions; include CLIMB_2 pain points (roles clarity, global collaboration).  
4. Deploy a **central KM portal** (Confluence + enterprise search + vector DB for semantic search of past projects).  
5. Sign multi-year partnership with specialist consultancies for on-demand expertise and coaching until internal capability reaches 80 %.

### 2.3 ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES
| Topic | Current | Target E |
|-------|---------|----------|
| AI integration in NPD | D | E |
| AI-driven automation | D | E |
| Decision support | A | E |
| Tools for AI teams | A | E |
| Continuous improvement cycles | D | E |

**Development Path & Actions**
1. Add **AI decision-support layer** in stage-gate reviews (predictive costing, demand forecasting, risk scoring).  
2. Standardise **AI toolchain** inside dev workflow (Jira plug-ins, Copilot for pull-requests, automated documentation).  
3. Implement **OKR-driven continuous-improvement loop** – weekly model performance dashboards, monthly Kaizen for NPD.  
4. Update product-development playbook to embed GenAI at each phase (ideation, concept engineering, virtual prototyping, digital twin testing, post-launch analytics).  
5. Address CLIMB_2 gaps: formalise cross-functional RACI, customer co-creation workshops, KPI framework (TTM, ROI, sustainability).
