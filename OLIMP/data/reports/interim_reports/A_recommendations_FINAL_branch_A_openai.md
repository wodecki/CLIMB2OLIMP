*Prepared: June 2024*

---

## 1. Executive Summary
The organization is financially prepared for large–scale AI adoption (Budget area mostly at Level E), but lags in:
* Products & Services – only 3 / 11 items are at Level E; the rest range from A–D.  
* Ethics & Regulations – only 3 / 11 items are at Level E; six are at A or B.

Top priorities:
1. Close critical ethical, legal and security gaps (EU AI Act readiness, AI audit, data privacy, staff awareness).  
2. Industrialize AI use cases in product development (idea generation → testing → marketing) and harden technical foundations (AI-ready product databases, API-ready applications).  
3. Institutionalize continuous funding for pilot/innovative projects (raise “pilot financing” from C → E).  

A phased program—Pilot & Foundations, Development & Scaling, Optimization & Excellence—will deliver Level E maturity across all remaining gaps in 36 months.

## 2. Analysis by Areas

### 2.1 BUDGET
| Sub-topic | Current | Gap | Main Challenges |
|-----------|---------|-----|-----------------|
| Long-term AI budget, employee upskilling, external consulting, value-based prioritization | E | 0 | Sustain governance, track ROI |
| Financing of pilots & innovation | C | D → E | Ad-hoc approvals slow experimentation |

**Recommended path**  
1. Establish a rolling “AI Innovation Fund” (≤ 2 % of annual revenue) with quarterly intake, lean approval (<3 weeks).  
2. Introduce Stage-Gate funding tied to measurable KPIs (see Section 5).  
3. Expand AI steering committee mandate to monitor fund performance and re-invest gains.

**Concrete actions (Phase 1)**  
* Draft fund charter & approval workflow.  
* Allocate seed budget (≈ US $ 300 k).  
* Publish internal call for pilot proposals.

---

### 2.2 PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
| Cluster | Current | Target | Key Barriers |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------|
| Personalization, concept evaluation, testing, marketing | D | E | Fragmented data, no unified ML ops |
| Idea/Sentiment mining, info reduction, recommender systems | B | E | Limited data pipelines, prompt skills |
| Product DB optimisation, AI components in apps, new use-case scouting | A | E | Legacy systems, lack of AI product owners |

**Development path**
1. Data Foundation – build a product knowledge graph & vector store; expose via secure APIs for generative AI.  
2. Use-case Factory – agile squads (designer, PM, data scientist, prompt engineer) iterate every 6 weeks.  
3. Embed AI in customer-facing & engineering applications via micro-services.

**Concrete actions**
* Stand-up RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) sandbox using Azure OpenAI + Pinecone/Weaviate.  
* Fine-tune recommendation models (e.g., NVIDIA Merlin, Amazon Personalize).  
* Deploy AI-driven A/B testing platform to reduce physical tests by ≥ 30 %.  
* Launch “AI Use-Case Safari” program—monthly ideation workshops + public hackathons.

---

### 2.3 ETHICS AND REGULATIONS
| Topic | Current | Goal | Urgency |
|-------|---------|------|---------|
| Ethical design principles, compliance assessment, audit systems, staff data-privacy awareness | A | E | Very high (EU AI Act, ISO 42001) |
| Data security & privacy | B | E | High |
| Explainability & trust | C | E | High |
| Cyber-security tech | C | E | High |
| Backup standards | D | E | Medium |

**Development path**
1. Adopt an AI Governance Framework (NIST AI RMF + EU AI Act alignment).  
2. Set up an internal “AI Ethics Board” with veto power on high-risk use cases.  
3. Implement Model Risk Management & automated audit logs (e.g., Arize, WhyLabs).

**Concrete actions**
* Draft and publish an “AI Code of Ethics” (Phase 1).  
* Deploy data-loss-prevention (DLP) and privacy-enhancing tech (PETs) in MLOps stack.  
* Mandate bias & explainability reports (SHAP, LIME) before production go-live.  
* Run mandatory privacy & AI-ethics training (LMS-based, tracked via KPI).
