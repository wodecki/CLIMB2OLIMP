## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines a strategic roadmap for the organization to transition its Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities from its current state to Level E (maximum maturity) across key operational areas. The assessment is based on the provided OLIMP gap analysis, supplemented by insights from the CLIMB_2 questionnaire regarding New Product Development (NPD) practices.

**Overall Assessment:**
The organization exhibits a mixed AI maturity profile. While foundational IT infrastructure scalability is strong (Level E), and People & Competencies show good progress (mostly Level D), significant gaps exist in critical areas. The **TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE** area, particularly concerning Generative AI (GenAI) integration, deployment automation, MLOps, real-time processing, and overall AI tool adoption, is largely at foundational levels (B or C). Most critically, the **BUDGET** allocation and strategic financial planning for AI initiatives are currently at Level A (non-existent), posing a fundamental barrier to transformation.

Interestingly, the **ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES** area is reported at Level E across all aspects in the OLIMP assessment. However, the CLIMB_2 questionnaire reveals potential underlying weaknesses in NPD process discipline, customer centricity, and knowledge management. This suggests that while AI tools or high-level policies might be in place, their effective, optimized, and deeply embedded application within robust business processes requires further attention to achieve true Level E impact.

**Key Areas Requiring Attention:**
1.  **Budget & Financial Governance:** The complete absence of AI-specific budgeting and financial planning (Level A) is the most urgent concern.
2.  **Technology & Infrastructure Modernization:** Advancing GenAI integration, MLOps practices, AI model deployment automation, real-time data capabilities, and compute power from current B/C levels.
3.  **People & Competencies Enhancement:** Elevating existing D-level capabilities to E, ensuring universal AI literacy, advanced skills, and a pervasive knowledge-sharing culture.
4.  **Organization & Process Realization:** Bridging the gap between the reported Level E in OLIMP and the practical process execution challenges highlighted by CLIMB_2. This involves ensuring AI is not just present but is effectively leveraging and enhancing well-defined, agile, and customer-focused NPD processes.

**Transformation Priorities:**
1.  **Establish AI Financial Foundations (Immediate Priority):** Secure dedicated AI budgets, develop a long-term financial strategy for AI, and implement processes for prioritizing AI investments based on value.
2.  **Strengthen Core AI Technology Stack:** Invest in integrating GenAI with enterprise systems (ERP, CRM), implement robust MLOps/LLMOps, enhance data infrastructure for real-time and large-scale AI, and expand AI tool accessibility.
3.  **Cultivate Universal AI Proficiency & Culture:** Move beyond general awareness to deep, role-specific AI skills across the organization, foster interdisciplinary AI teams, and establish dynamic AI knowledge management.
4.  **Optimize and Validate AI in Processes:** Leverage AI to improve underlying NPD process discipline (informed by CLIMB_2), validate the impact of AI in processes with clear metrics, and ensure continuous AI-driven process innovation.

This transformation, executed systematically through the proposed phased approach, will enable the organization to unlock significant efficiencies, drive innovation, and secure a strong competitive advantage.

### C. ORGANIZATION AND PROCESSES

**Current State and Main Challenges:**
The OLIMP assessment indicates Level E (full maturity) across all questions in this area. This suggests the organization believes it has fully integrated AI into NPD, automated processes with GenAI, uses AI for all decision-making, has tools for AI teams, continuous improvement cycles, AI software lifecycle management, and a GenAI-based NPD guide.

However, the CLIMB_2 questionnaire paints a different picture of the underlying NPD process maturity:
*   "Jak jasno są zdefiniowane role i obowiązki każdej osoby?" (Clarity of roles/responsibilities): **B** (Defined, but often unclear).
*   "Jak w pełni klient jest zaangażowany w proces rozwoju produktu?" (Customer involvement in NPD): **A** (Not involved).
*   "W jakim stopniu formalny model rozwoju produktu jest przestrzegany i dokumentowany?" (Adherence to formal NPD model): **B** (Rarely followed/documented).
*   "Jak skutecznie kompleksowy zestaw KPI jest używany do mierzenia wydajności rozwoju produktu?" (Use of comprehensive KPIs for NPD): **A** (No comprehensive set).
*   "W jakim stopniu proces rozwoju produktu koncentruje się na wartości dla klienta?" (Focus on customer value in NPD): **A** (Not focused).

The primary challenge is to reconcile these perspectives. Achieving true Level E means AI is not just theoretically available or documented but is demonstrably enhancing well-managed, efficient, and customer-centric processes, delivering measurable value. The 'E' in OLIMP might reflect an *enabling environment* or *availability of tools*, but CLIMB_2 suggests the *actual process execution* needs significant improvement for AI to be truly impactful.

**Recommended Development Paths & Concrete Actions:**
Since all areas are rated 'E' in OLIMP, the focus shifts from "achieving E" to "validating and deepening E" by addressing the practical gaps identified in CLIMB_2 and leveraging AI to enhance core process capabilities.

1.  **Validate and Deepen AI Integration in NPD Processes (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Conduct an audit of current AI integration in NPD. Map AI tools and techniques to specific NPD stages.
    *   **Action:** Use AI for Process Mining to understand the *actual* NPD workflows, identify deviations from the "fully integrated AI" state, and pinpoint bottlenecks (addresses CLIMB_2 "Formal NPD model rarely followed").
    *   **Action:** Implement AI-driven solutions to enhance customer involvement (addresses CLIMB_2 "Customer not involved"). Examples:
        *   GenAI for analyzing customer feedback from surveys, social media, support tickets to identify unmet needs and product improvement ideas.
        *   AI-powered platforms for co-creation and virtual customer feedback sessions.
    *   **Action:** Develop and track AI-specific KPIs for NPD processes (e.g., reduction in design iterations due to AI, speed of prototype generation with AI). This links to CLIMB_2 "No comprehensive set of KPIs for NPD".

2.  **Optimize and Expand GenAI Automation in NPD (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Review current "fully automated" processes. Identify areas where GenAI can provide *further* automation or enhance the quality of automation (e.g., generating more diverse design concepts, automating complex test case generation, drafting initial technical documentation).
    *   **Action:** Explore advanced GenAI for tasks like code generation for software components, material selection, or predictive modeling of product performance.

3.  **Enhance AI-Supported Decision-Making (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Ensure decision-support AI systems are transparent and explainable (XAI). Train decision-makers on interpreting AI outputs and understanding model limitations.
    *   **Action:** Implement AI tools to explicitly support decisions related to customer value (addresses CLIMB_2 "NPD not focused on customer value"). For example, AI models that predict customer lifetime value impact of new features.
    *   **Action:** Use AI to improve the definition and clarity of roles and responsibilities in AI-driven projects (addresses CLIMB_2 "Roles and responsibilities unclear").

4.  **Maximize Value from AI Team Support Tools (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Continuously evaluate and upgrade tools for AI teams, incorporating the latest advancements in LLMOps, collaborative AI development environments, and data annotation/management.
    *   **Action:** Ensure these tools facilitate seamless collaboration within interdisciplinary teams.

5.  **Drive Continuous Improvement with Advanced AI (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Go beyond standard continuous improvement. Use AI itself to identify opportunities for breakthrough innovations in AI deployment and NPD.
    *   **Action:** Implement AI-driven A/B testing frameworks for NPD process changes and AI model updates.

6.  **Evolve AI Software Lifecycle Management (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Ensure the lifecycle process includes robust AI ethics reviews, bias detection and mitigation steps, and mechanisms for managing model drift and decay.
    *   **Action:** Integrate security best practices (DevSecOps for AI) throughout the AI software lifecycle.

7.  **Dynamically Update GenAI-Based NPD Process Guide (OLIMP: E):**
    *   **Action:** Treat the NPD guide as a living document. Use AI to analyze the effectiveness of the guide and suggest improvements based on project outcomes and team feedback.
    *   **Action:** Ensure the guide explicitly incorporates strategies for addressing the process weaknesses identified in CLIMB_2 (e.g., mandatory customer feedback loops, standardized KPI reporting).
