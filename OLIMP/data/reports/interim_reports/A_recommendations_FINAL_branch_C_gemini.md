## 1. Executive Summary

This report outlines a strategic roadmap for the organization to transition its Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities from its current state to a level of excellence (Level E) across key operational areas. The assessment is based on the OLIMP gap analysis, with supplementary insights from the CLIMB_2 questionnaire to understand the broader business context, particularly concerning New Product Development (NPD).

**Overall Assessment:**
The organization exhibits a mixed level of AI maturity. Strengths are evident in areas like scalable IT infrastructure for AI (Level E), automated Generative AI model deployment (Level E), awareness of Generative AI (Level E), and established Generative AI project management training (Level E). However, significant gaps exist, particularly in foundational and operational aspects.

**Key Areas Requiring Attention:**

*   **Technology and Infrastructure:**
    *   **Critical:** Lack of sufficient computing power for AI (Level A).
    *   **Major Gaps:** Minimal cloud adoption for AI data and processing (Level B), basic integration of Generative AI with core systems like ERP/CRM (Level B), insufficient AI model lifecycle management (MLOps) tools and practices (Level B), and limited infrastructure for handling large AI datasets (Level B).
*   **People and Competencies:**
    *   **Major Gaps:** Insufficient training in AI programming (including prompt engineering) and data analysis (Level B).
    *   **Areas for Improvement:** Development of interdisciplinary AI teams (Level C), strategic engagement of external AI consultants (Level C), and broader adoption of the knowledge management platform for AI (Level C).
*   **Organization and Processes:**
    *   **Critical:** Absence of continuous improvement cycles for AI implementations (Level A).
    *   **Major Gaps:** Basic automation of product development processes using Generative AI (Level B), limited use of AI for decision support (Level C), and inadequate tooling for AI teams (Level B).
*   **Budget and Funding:**
    *   **Critical:** Lack of long-term budget planning for Generative AI development (Level A) and no dedicated funding for AI pilot projects (Level A).
    *   **Major Gaps:** Sporadic funding for AI competency development (Level B).

**Transformation Priorities:**

1.  **Establish Foundational AI Infrastructure:** Immediately address the critical lack of computing power and initiate a strategic shift towards cloud-based AI data processing and storage.
2.  **Secure Dedicated AI Budget & Foster Innovation:** Implement long-term AI budget planning and allocate funds for pilot projects and competency development. This is a prerequisite for sustained progress.
3.  **Develop Core AI Skills:** Launch comprehensive training programs focusing on practical AI skills (data analysis, prompt engineering, MLOps) for relevant teams.
4.  **Integrate and Automate:** Prioritize the integration of Generative AI with key business systems and automate NPD processes where AI can deliver high value.
5.  **Cultivate a Culture of Continuous AI Improvement:** Establish formal processes for continuous learning and improvement in all AI initiatives.

This transformation will require a phased approach, dedicated resources, and strong leadership commitment. The CLIMB_2 findings indicate broader challenges in NPD process maturity, collaboration, and knowledge management, which AI can help address, but also highlight the need for parallel improvements in these areas to maximize AI's impact.
